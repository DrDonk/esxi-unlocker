## 22/10/22 4.0.3
* Reinstate libvmkctl patch to allow vCenter to boot macOS VMs on ESXi host
* Reinstate boot time load so the libvmkctl patch is loaded when hostd starts
  * A new prompt allows you to decide whether to make the patches persistent 
  * It is recommended that you use this method to make persistent but make sure you relock/unlock if a new ESXi patch or version is installed

## 22/09/22 4.0.2
Thanks to _lucaskamp_ and an _anonymous_ tester for testing.
 
_drdonk:_
* Revert to binary file read/writes in patchsmc instead of using mmap, which caused silent errors during the patching 
process leading to failed patches.
* Modified VMTAR format from PSIGNED-XZ to GZIP
* Commands are now required to be run each boot of ESXi to avoid possible "Purple Screens of Death" (PSOD).
* Ensure vmx files have correct permissions, 4555/-r-sr-xr-x,  in apple.v00 archive
