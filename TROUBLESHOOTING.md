# Troubleshooting Notes

## Set a specific macOS Guest resolution

Installing the VMWare Tools should allow different video modes to be selected. If you have already installed them and still does not change resolution you can try this. Open Terminal and run:

`sudo /Library/Application Support/VMware Tools/vmware-resolutionSet <width> <height>`

where width and height are the pixel size you want. For example to get 1440x900:

`sudo /Library/Application Support/VMware Tools/vmware-resolutionSet 1440 900`

### AMD CPUs
A patched macOS AMD kernel must be used to run on older AMD systems, but there is a workaround if you have a modern
AMD Ryzen CPU. The unlocker cannot patch this but we can recommend settings for the VMX file that allows macOS to
run on recent AMD CPUs. The tests are being recorded in this issue, and it would be useful if more can report
success or failures in that issue.

1. Read this KB article to learn how to edit a guest's VMX file safely https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2057902
2. Add the following lines were to the VMX file:
```
cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"
cpuid.0.edx = "0100:1001:0110:0101:0110:1110:0110:1001"
cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"
cpuid.1.ebx = "0000:0010:0000:0001:0000:1000:0000:0000"
cpuid.1.ecx = "1000:0010:1001:1000:0010:0010:0000:0011"
cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
vhv.enable = "FALSE"
vpmc.enable = "FALSE"
```
3. Make sure there are no duplicate lines in the VMX file or the guest will not start and a dictionary error will
   be displayed by VMware.
4. You can now install and run macOS as a guest.
